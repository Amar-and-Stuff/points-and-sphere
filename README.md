Hello,
	This project is about a sphere of unit radius and some(2<=N>=20) points on the surface of sphere and their position on one condition ie. each point tries to keep other points at maximum distance. No point is special. Any point has exactly same privilages as any other point on the sphere. So, after every point settles down, they achieves an equilibrium(I think), they form a shape. what shape is it? Let's find out.
